## Abstract
The purpose of this research is to create a model which can efficiently store slices of MRI scans. This is achieved with a hybrid model combining wavelet approximation features as an input to a sparse auto-encoder network. Training and test data was provided by FastMRI, a joint venture between NYU and Facebook (Meta).

## Use Case

* JPEG compression is optimized for general images
* But what about images that share common features?
* I propose a model that combines signal pre-processing and deep learning to efficiently compress MRI scans

## Dataset
* Approved use of [FastMRI](https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/) dataset from Facebook (Meta) and NYU
* Only using subset of the multicoil_test dataset ~34.2GB zipped
* 1 brain for test (16 slices), 26 brains for evaluation (14 - 16 slices each)
* Open source [software suite](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI) for slicing and manipulating data

## Generational Loss
* Recursive JPEG compressions quickly erodes quality (photocopier effect)
* After only a few iterations, JPEG compression succumbs to noise corruption
* Wavelet basis is very resilient to recursive operations

* Quantized k-wavelet compression results in quality loss in only first compression!
