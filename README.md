## Abstract
The purpose of this research is to create a model
which can efficiently store slices of MRI scans. Efficiency is ex-
plored across two optimization domains; minimization of genera-
tional loss through recursive compression, and compressed space
minimization. Some techniques and frameworks explored include
k-wavelet approximation, and various auto-encoder frameworks
for neural networks. Training and test data was provided by
FastMRI, a joint venture between NYU and Facebook (Meta).

## Use Case

* JPEG compression is optimized for general images
* But what about images that share common features?
* Various deep learning and signal processing techniques are explored for new MRI compression schemes 

## Dataset
* Approved use of [FastMRI](https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/) dataset from Facebook (Meta) and NYU
* Only using subset of the multicoil_test dataset ~34.2GB zipped
* 1 brain for test (16 slices), 26 brains for evaluation (14 - 16 slices each)
* Open source [software suite](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI) for slicing and manipulating data

## Generational Loss

### JPEG Generational Loss
* Recursive JPEG compressions quickly erodes quality (photocopier effect)
* After only a few iterations, JPEG compression succumbs to noise corruption

### Quantized K-Wavelet Generational Loss

* Wavelet basis is very resilient to recursive operations
* Subject k-wavelet coefficients to float32 quantization
* Results in quality loss in only first compression!
* Compression size of 14.4 KB

## Deep Learning
* Can compress further with sparse auto-encoder via convolutional neural network framework
* Captures image features well, but very lossy

## Try It Yourself
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone www.github.com/athornton1618/MRI_Compression.git
cd MRI_Compression
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Obtain permission for [FastMRI](https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/) dataset
4. Download multicoil_test dataset with following command:
```
curl -C - "https://fastmri-dataset.s3.amazonaws.com/brain_multicoil_test.tar.gz?AWSAccessKeyId=YOUR TOKEN" --output brain_multicoil_test.tar.gz
mkdir MRI_Compression/data
```
3. Unzip multicoil_test
4. Move files to MRI_Compression/data/multicoil_test
5. You can run any of the scripts locally on your machine from this point, except sparse_autoencoder_cnn_colab.ipynb
6. Run this python command to build the dataset for Colab:
```
cd utils
python make_dataset.py
```
7. Open sparse_autoencoder_cnn_colab.ipynb in Google Colab
8. Under the 'Files' tab in Colab, make directory /data, and upload the following from MRI_Compression/data:
    * train_set_image.json
    * train_set_wavelet.json
    * test_set_image.json
    * test_set_wavelet.json
9. Run sparse_autoencoder_cnn_colab.ipynb
